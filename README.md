# Relocation-Loader
To implement a Relocatable Loader using the bit mask method and modification records to enable flexible loading and linking of code at various memory locations.


This project simplifies loading and linking modular code by implementing a Relocatable Loader using the bit mask method and modification records. It enables loading relocatable object code into memory, adjusting addresses with bit masks, and handling dynamic changes through modification records. The bit mask method associates a relocation bit with each word of object code, allowing flexibility in loading programs at different memory locations. Modification records play a crucial role in handling changes in memory addresses due to external references, ensuring flexibility and relocatability in software systems.
